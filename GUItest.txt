First, write "javac GUI.java" and "java GUI" into the command line. This should open the GUI.
Note: only look at the first line that is printed out for each test. Anything after that tests the other functions. You
can comment out the calls to other functions if you want to test just the GUI.java standalone file. We didn't want to do
this because it may mess up the program when testing the project as a whole.
Also, there seem to be no edge cases. Also, since we set the parameters of a valid sentence, it was hard to think of
edge cases. We find that even for some not valid sentences, like the first test, the GUI works by printing exactly what
was typed in.

Test 1: Type nothing, or in other words, "", and press the button that says "click me".
First line output: (GUI Test) You just typed:

Test 2: Type "I saw a thug on the blacklist." and press the button that says "click me".
First line output: (GUI Test) You just typed: I saw a thug on the blacklist.

Test 3: Type "Thank you for all your help throughout this course." and press the button that says "click me".
(GUI Test) You just typed: Thank you for all your help throughout this course.

Test 4: Type a period, or in other words, ".", and press the button that says "click me".
First line output: (GUI Test) You just typed: .
